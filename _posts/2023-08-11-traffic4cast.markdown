We explore different uncertainty quantification methods on a large-scale image-based <a href="https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/2021-competition/challenge/">traffic dataset</a> spanning multiple cities and time periods, originally featured as a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17070">NeurIPS 2021 prediction challenge</a>. Meaningful uncertainty relating to traffic dynamics is recovered by a combination method of deep ensembles and patch-based deviations. In a case study, we demonstrate how uncertainty estimates can be employed for unsupervised outlier detection on traffic behaviour.
