<p><strong>Mar 28, 2023</strong>: Had an interesting time at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence HQ in <a href="https://www.bosch-ai.com/about-us/our-locations/">Renningen</a> in the context of a lab visit organized by the <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/">Delta Lab</a>. It was great to meet my Bosch co-supervisors in person and see how our research can potentially translate to Bosch applications, such as in autonomous driving and robotics.</p>
