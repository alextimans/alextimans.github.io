<p><strong>Sep 1, 2023</strong>: I was happy to participate in the <a href="https://fcai.fi/eds2023/home">ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2023</a> in Helsinki, Finland! A lot of fun activities (and sauna galore) and great to see so many fellow ML PhD students enthusiastically present their work. Particularly interesting discussions on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02738">calibration for regression</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12783">conformal prediction for time series</a> â€“ thanks and maybe see you next year!</p>
