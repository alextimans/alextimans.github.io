<p><strong>Oct 7, 2023</strong>: Participated in <a href="https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/">ICCV 2023</a> in Paris to present our poster on ‘Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainty via Conformal Prediction’ at the <a href="https://uncv2023.github.io/">Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification in Computer Vision</a> – thanks to the organizers! It was fun to see the thriving ML community and the various research directions, particularly in the computer vision domain. Notably, there was a lot of work on multi-modality and foundation model finetuning. Some interesting thoughts on the current state of the field were given in the <a href="https://gkioxari.github.io/Tutorials/iccv2023/">Quo Vadis, Computer Vision</a> workshop by the likes of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5H0arvkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">David Forsyth</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0zZnyMEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra">Bill Freeman</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aOklxsQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Jitendra Malik</a> – is “putting language into vision” the best approach? Also got to catch <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WLN3QrAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Yann LeCun</a> in person at the Meta booth!</p>
