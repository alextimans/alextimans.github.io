<p><strong>Jan 29, 2024</strong>: Due to Eric’s switch from the University of Amsterdam to <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> in Baltimore, I am happy to have 
<a href="https://naesseth.github.io/">Christian Naesseth</a> join as a co-supervisor alongside Eric. Christian has done very interesting work in probabilistic modeling and we share a common interest in statistical ML topics such as conformal prediction and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-38/issue-4/Game-Theoretic-Statistics-and-Safe-Anytime-Valid-Inference/10.1214/23-STS894.full">e-values</a> – here’s to a nice collaboration!</p>
