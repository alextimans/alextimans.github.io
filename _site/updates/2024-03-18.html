<p><strong>Mar 18, 2024</strong>: Good times attending the <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/mlss">Machine Learning Summer School</a> in Okinawa at <a href="https://www.oist.jp/">OIST</a>, with particularly interesting talks by 
<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shai/">Shai Ben-David</a> and <a href="https://pierrealquier.github.io/index.html">Pierre Alquier</a> on PAC and PAC-Bayes respectively â€“ the evolution of generalization bounds continues. The OIST campus is breath-taking, and Okinawa seems like a bit of a hidden gem for beach getaways. Continuing the adventure with travels across Japan (Tokyo, Fuji, Kyoto, Osaka) until end of month, including a short visit to the <a href="https://aip.riken.jp/?lang=en">RIKEN AIP</a> in Tokyo!</p>
