<p><strong>May 23, 2024</strong>: On the side, I’ve been working with a small student team on an idea related to conformal prediction for time series. We’ve fleshed it out into a full paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16766">Conformal time series decomposition with component-wise exchangeability</a>, which has been accepted at this year’s <a href="https://copa-conference.com/">COPA</a> symposium, the dedicated venue for conformal prediction research! Looking forward to attending the conference in Milan in September, and hopefully meeting some of the field’s founding figures like Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GJE29ekAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Vladimir Vovk</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoWoR4gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Alexander Gammerman</a>.</p>
