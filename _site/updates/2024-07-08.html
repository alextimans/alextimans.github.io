<p><strong>Jul 8, 2024</strong>: Happy to have our paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07263">Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainties via Two-Step Conformal Prediction</a> accepted at this year’s <a href="https://eccv2024.ecva.net/">European Conference on Computer Vision</a> (ECCV)! We extended our workshop paper from last year to incorporate classification uncertainty using a two-step conformal approach – looking forward to sharing it with the vision community. And yes, that will be me visiting Milan twice in September.</p>
