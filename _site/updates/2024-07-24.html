<p><strong>Jul 24, 2024</strong>: I’m glad to announce a new preprint, great joint work with my lab mate <a href="https://metodj.github.io/">Metod Jazbec</a>. Our paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20915">Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control</a> addresses how to select the exit threshold for early-exit models with performance guarantees via risk control. I’m presenting our work at two ICML workshops this week: one focused on <a href="https://spigmworkshop2024.github.io/">probabilistic inference</a> (SPIGM), and one on <a href="https://es-fomo.com/">efficient inference</a> (ES-FOMO). Hoping this will get both communities excited (and beyond) about the usefulness of statistical ML for all kinds of applications!</p>
