<p><strong>Aug 21, 2024</strong>: Our accepted paper at ECCV received an <strong>Oral</strong> (top 3%), providing us with an opportunity to present our motivation to a wider audience! Seems like the vision community is indeed excited about the possibilities of conformal prediction to advance safety aspects in the field. We will also be presenting at the ECCV Workshop on <a href="https://uncertainty-cv.github.io/2024//">Uncertainty Quantification for Computer Vision</a> amidst the uncertainty community.</p>
