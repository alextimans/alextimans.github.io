<p><strong>Nov 8, 2024</strong>: Attended the <a href="https://riannedeheide.github.io/eday.html">E-Day</a> organized by Rianne de Heide, and hosted next door at CWI. It was fun to learn about some of the (local) research on E-values and safe statistics, and I particularly enjoyed the talk by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CaNXAqEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Glenn Shafer</a>, one of the founding fathers of game-theoretic statistics. Awesome that he joined.</p>
