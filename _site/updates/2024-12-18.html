<p><strong>Dec 18, 2024</strong>: Really enjoyed NeurIPS, not only to present our own work but to visit a bunch of related posters and talk to researchers from across the globe, incl. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_m67ywAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Yaniv Romano</a> and his team from Technion, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m1xeKH4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Osvaldo Simeone</a> and his UCL group, students from UC Berkley, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, JP Morgan Research, KAIST, etc. So many smart people doing interesting work! Vancouver is also pretty, and warmer than expected. Side topic: Iâ€™m co-supervising <em>three</em> master students on their thesis, jointly with Rajeev and Xiaoyan on topics ranging from recommender systems to uncertainty for SAM.</p>
