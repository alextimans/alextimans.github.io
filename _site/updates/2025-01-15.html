<p><strong>Jan 15, 2025</strong>: Hello Tokyo, また会えて嬉しいよ！ I’ll be spending the next three months at <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/">RIKEN AIP</a>, Japan’s national research institute. Specifically, I’ll be learning about a Bayesian perspective on optimization through <em>variational learning</em> as part of the <a href="https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/">Approximate Bayesian Inference Team</a>, under leadership of <a href="https://emtiyaz.github.io/">Emtiyaz Khan</a>. They are taking a very exciting perspective on Bayesian deep learning, go check out their latest <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17641">IVON optimizer</a> that scales to GPT-tier models!</p>
