<p><strong>Feb 12, 2025</strong>: Yay, our work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10900">Max-Rank: Efficient Multiple Testing for Conformal Prediction</a> on permutation-based multiple testing was accepted to AISTATS 2025! That means Thailand in May, who thought machine learning can take you to so many places. We switched up the paper name to better reflect our contributions, and give a simple solution to multiple testing issues. Iâ€™ve been collaborating on two other projects in the meantime, with preprints coming soon (the usual IP things). Keywords: geometric deep learning (yup) and sequential hypothesis testing!</p>
