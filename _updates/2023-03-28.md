**Mar 28, 2023**: Had an interesting time at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence HQ in [Renningen](https://www.bosch-ai.com/about-us/our-locations/) in the context of a lab visit organized by the [Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/). It was great to meet my Bosch co-supervisors in person and see how our research can potentially translate to Bosch applications, such as in autonomous driving and robotics.
