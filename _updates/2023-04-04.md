**Apr 4, 2023**: Started a bachelor thesis supervision project on conformal prediction for time series, as well as TA'ing the [Deep Learning 2](https://uvadl2c.github.io) course with a module on uncertainty quantification. I am also supervising a course project on Bayesian [subnetwork inference](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/daxberger21a.html).
