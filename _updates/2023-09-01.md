**Sep 1, 2023**: I was happy to participate in the [ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2023](https://fcai.fi/eds2023/home) in Helsinki, Finland! A lot of fun activities (and sauna galore) and great to see so many fellow ML PhD students enthusiastically present their work. Particularly interesting discussions on [calibration for regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02738) and [conformal prediction for time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12783) -- thanks and maybe see you next year!
