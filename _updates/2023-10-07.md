**Oct 7, 2023**: Participated in [ICCV 2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) in Paris to present our poster on 'Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainty via Conformal Prediction' at the [Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification in Computer Vision](https://uncv2023.github.io/) -- thanks to the organizers! It was fun to see the thriving ML community and the various research directions, particularly in the computer vision domain. Notably, there was a lot of work on multi-modality and foundation model finetuning. Some interesting thoughts on the current state of the field were given in the [Quo Vadis, Computer Vision](https://gkioxari.github.io/Tutorials/iccv2023/) workshop by the likes of [David Forsyth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5H0arvkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Bill Freeman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0zZnyMEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), and [Jitendra Malik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aOklxsQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) -- is "putting language into vision" the best approach? Also got to catch [Yann LeCun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WLN3QrAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in person at the Meta booth!
