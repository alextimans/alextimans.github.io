**Nov 20, 2023**: I am glad to see my student [Derck Prinzhorn](https://dweprinz.github.io/) receive an [Amsterdam AI Thesis award](https://amsterdamai.com/en/nieuws/2f9fad29-c3de-8e3e-1c67-9fb503f14f90/Recap-Amsterdam-AI-Highlights-Event) for his bachelor thesis on [conformal prediction](https://github.com/dweprinz/Benchmarking-conformal-prediction-methods-for-time-series-regression), and present his work to the local community. He worked diligently at the intersection of multiple complicated topics -- well done!
