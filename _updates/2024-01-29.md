**Jan 29, 2024**: Due to Eric's switch from the University of Amsterdam to [Johns Hopkins](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) in Baltimore, I am happy to have 
[Christian Naesseth](https://naesseth.github.io/) join as a co-supervisor alongside Eric. Christian has done very interesting work in probabilistic modeling and we share a common interest in statistical ML topics such as conformal prediction and [e-values](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-38/issue-4/Game-Theoretic-Statistics-and-Safe-Anytime-Valid-Inference/10.1214/23-STS894.full) -- here's to a nice collaboration!
