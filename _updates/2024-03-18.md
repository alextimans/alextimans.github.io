**Mar 18, 2024**: Good times attending the [Machine Learning Summer School](https://groups.oist.jp/mlss) in Okinawa at [OIST](https://www.oist.jp/), with particularly interesting talks by 
[Shai Ben-David](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shai/) and [Pierre Alquier](https://pierrealquier.github.io/index.html) on PAC and PAC-Bayes respectively -- the evolution of generalization bounds continues. The OIST campus is breath-taking, and Okinawa seems like a bit of a hidden gem for beach getaways. Continuing the adventure with travels across Japan (Tokyo, Fuji, Kyoto, Osaka) until end of month, including a short visit to the [RIKEN AIP](https://aip.riken.jp/?lang=en) in Tokyo!
