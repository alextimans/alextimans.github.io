**May 23, 2024**: On the side, I've been working with a small student team on an idea related to conformal prediction for time series. We've fleshed it out into a full paper titled [Conformal time series decomposition with component-wise exchangeability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16766), which has been accepted at this year's [COPA](https://copa-conference.com/) symposium, the dedicated venue for conformal prediction research! Looking forward to attending the conference in Milan in September, and hopefully meeting some of the field's founding figures like Prof. [Vladimir Vovk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GJE29ekAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Alexander Gammerman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoWoR4gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
