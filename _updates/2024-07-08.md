**Jul 8, 2024**: Happy to have our paper titled [Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainties via Two-Step Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07263) accepted at this year's [European Conference on Computer Vision](https://eccv2024.ecva.net/) (ECCV)! We extended our workshop paper from last year to incorporate classification uncertainty using a two-step conformal approach -- looking forward to sharing it with the vision community. And yes, that will be me visiting Milan twice in September.
