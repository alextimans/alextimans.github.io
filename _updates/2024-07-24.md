**Jul 24, 2024**: I'm glad to announce a new preprint, great joint work with my lab mate [Metod Jazbec](https://metodj.github.io/). Our paper titled [Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20915) addresses how to select the exit threshold for early-exit models with performance guarantees via risk control. I'm presenting our work at two ICML workshops this week: one focused on [probabilistic inference](https://spigmworkshop2024.github.io/) (SPIGM), and one on [efficient inference](https://es-fomo.com/) (ES-FOMO). Hoping this will get both communities excited (and beyond) about the usefulness of statistical ML for all kinds of applications!
