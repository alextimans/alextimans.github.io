**Sept 26, 2024**: Happy to have our work on risk control for early-exiting accepted at NeurIPS 2024! After promoting its usefulness for efficient but safe inference already at ICML this summer, we are also continuing the message in (wintery?) Vancouver. Side topic \#1: The [COPA](https://copa-conference.com/) symposium in Milan was great, and I was impressed how positive, down-to-earth and tight-knit the conformal community is. Would love to attend again should the opportunity arise. Side topic \#2: After quite the lead time finally got admitted to the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD program! I'm on the industry track, since we're working with Bosch.
