**Oct 10, 2024**: ECCV was fun, and I attended a few talks on topics far outside my own (e.g. 3D modelling) that really impressed me with their demos. Uncertainty researchers, including myself, should try harder to really get their ideas -- motivated from a reliability angle -- into practice. Also, thanks Xiaoyan for a great snapshot from my oral talk. Cool side announcement: after slowly being in the works since the MLSS in Okinawa, I'm happy to confirm I'll be doing a research stay with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) and the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/) at RIKEN AIP in Tokyo, starting coming January. I'm always trying to learn new things, and explore all facets (incl. the Bayesian angle) of uncertainty quantification!
