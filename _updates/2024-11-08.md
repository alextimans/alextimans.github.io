**Nov 8, 2024**: Attended the [E-Day](https://riannedeheide.github.io/eday.html) organized by Rianne de Heide, and hosted next door at CWI. It was fun to learn about some of the (local) research on E-values and safe statistics, and I particularly enjoyed the talk by [Glenn Shafer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CaNXAqEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), one of the founding fathers of game-theoretic statistics. Awesome that he joined.
