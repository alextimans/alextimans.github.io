**Jan 15, 2025**: Hello Tokyo, また会えて嬉しいよ！ I'll be spending the next three months at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/), Japan's national research institute. Specifically, I'll be learning about a Bayesian perspective on optimization through *variational learning* as part of the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/), under leadership of [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/). They are taking a very exciting perspective on Bayesian deep learning, go check out their latest [IVON optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17641) that scales to GPT-tier models!
